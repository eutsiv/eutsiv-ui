- Viewport is a component, it must be the root component of every application
- We will have just one breakpoint: small screens and the rest
- Grid system will have 24 columns
- Fonts sizes are relative to Viewport (EM), no from the html tag
- Custom sizes will be: xs (extra small), sm (small), de (default), lg (large), xl (extra large), hu (huge)


FIX - grid should be height 100% only when using vertical row control (VBOX, vertical grid)
FIX - add configs size and offset for Row when using vertical grid
FIX - vertical/grid/align/vbox must be implemented by javascript, margin-top percent is based in the width, and top is relative to the root element, so it is not a good option to implement it through CSS - It is an old comment, I think css flexbox or grid may help here
